# Diff_LSTM

Accurate time series prediction is challenging due to the inherent nonlinearity and sensitivity to initial conditions. We propose a novel approach that enhances neural network predictions through differential learning, which involves training models on both the original time series and its differential series. Specifically, we develop a differential long short-term memory (Diff-LSTM) network that uses a shared LSTM cell to simultaneously process both data streams, effectively capturing intrinsic patterns and temporal dynamics. Evaluated on the Mackey-Glass, Lorenz, and RÃ¶ssler chaotic time series, as well as a real-world financial dataset from ACI Worldwide Inc., our results demonstrate that the Diff-LSTM network outperforms prevalent models such as recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and bidirectional and encoder-decoder LSTM networks in both short-term and long-term predictions. This framework offers a promising solution for enhancing time series prediction, even when comprehensive knowledge of the underlying dynamics of the time series is not fully available.
